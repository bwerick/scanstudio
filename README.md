# Segmentation Project

This project is focused on processing and segmenting OCR (Optical Character Recognition) data. It includes tools and scripts to parse OCR outputs and prepare them for further analysis or processing.

## Features

- Extract text from videos of documents.
- Parse raw OCR outputs into structured formats.
- Clean and preprocess OCR data for downstream AI/ML.
- Export video scans to PDF.

## Parsing text from videos

The `make parse_OCR` target is designed to parse OCR data and extract meaningful information. This target automates the process of handling raw OCR outputs, cleaning the data, and organizing it into a structured format.

Put your videos in `Videos/` before continuing. These are videos of flipping pages of documents. The OCR will be run on these videos, and the output will be saved in the `test_frames/` directory.

### Usage

Once the videos are in the appropriate directory, simply execute the following command (from the main project directory):
```bash
make parse_OCR
```

### Example

### Example: Parsing OCR data from a sample video

To parse OCR data from a sample video, follow these steps:

1. Place your video file in the `Videos/` directory (e.g., `sample_video.mov`).
2. Run the following command from the main project directory:
    ```bash
    make parse_OCR
    ```
3. The output will be saved in the `test_frames/` directory.
4. Check the structured output in `test_frames/sample_video.mov/`.
